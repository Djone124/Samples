Sample Monte Carlo

In this repository is sample Microsoft Excel documents. This document should serve as a sample of the number of capabilities of doing Monte Carlo simulation in Excel. 

	1. Monte Carlo Simulation with Normal and Monte Carlo Integration
	Sheet 1: Simulates Rolling Die for wage calculation. Demonstrates the value of Monte Carlo Simulation over Expected Value calculations. 
	Sheet 2: Monte Carlo Integration done for the radius of an arc of a circle, ellipse, and for a normal distribution. Serves as a rough approximation for the integral from 0 to some set value.
